sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
that we all can love
that we all can love
that we all
sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
that we all can love
that we all can love
that we all

and now I see you messing me around
i don't want to know
i don't want to know
i don't want
and now I see you messing me around
i don't want to know
i don't want to know
i don't want to know

broken hearts make it rain

broken hearts make it rain
broken hearts make it rain
broken hearts make it rain
broken hearts make it rain

broken hearts make it rain
broken hearts make it rain
broken hearts make it rain
broken hearts make it rain
broken hearts make it rain
broken hearts make it rain
broken hearts make it rain
broken hearts make it rain

pieces of a ragdoll mankind
that we can create
that we can create
that we can
the pieces of a ragdoll mankind

i don't want to know
i don't want
when I see you messing me around
i don't want to know
i don't want to know
