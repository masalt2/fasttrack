The lyrics go:
<pre>
then in your life, there comes the darkness
there's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
and there's nowhere to hide
you run to the back and you cover your ears
but it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
and all we trapped, ragdoll, cloth people
we are helpless to resist
into our darkest hour

but it was just a laugh, just a laugh, just a laugh, just a laugh
even at this angle, and so we crumble
a ten ton head made of wet sand, this dread circumference
you gotta be kidding me, the grass grows over me
your face in the glass, in the glass, it was just a laugh, just a laugh
it's whatever you say it is, in split infinities

then into your life, there comes a darkness
and a spacecraft blocking out the sky
and there's nowhere to hide
you run to the back and you cover your ears
but it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
into your darkest hour

when you've had enough of me
when you've had enough of me
sweet times

when you've had enough of me
when you've had enough of me
sweet times

sweet times

sweet times

sweet times
</pre></div>
