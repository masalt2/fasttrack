The lyrics go:
<pre>
i'd go anywhere that i want
just gotta turn myself inside out
and back to front

cut out chinks and worn out spaces
and add some sprinkles to create
a ride full fast

they're all smiling so i guess i'll stay
at least till they dissappoint
feeling themselves away

buried
from the waist down
stopping over
your shoulders
they need to get it
together

all the window balconies
they seem so flimsy
when our friends step out to
catch and wave and
catch a piece of sun

i guess i believe
an altered state
cause here the leave the windows
and the doors
open wide

the telephone lines
are always busy
they tell all the children
to play
inside

get it
together
stop looking over
our shoulders

all the window balconies
they take tumble
when our friends step out to
catch and wave and
catch a piece of sun

i wanna know
where did it go
where did it go
i wanna know
i wanna know
where did it go
where did it go
somebody stop them

a friend of a friend
a friend of a friend
a friend of a friend
a friend of a friend
a friend of a friend
a friend of a friend
a friend of a friend
a friend of a friend
a friend of a friend
