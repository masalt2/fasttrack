The lyrics go:
<pre>
you know the time is right
you know the end has come
for half million (for half a million)
by half a million

that's your opinion
that's how your story goes
a magic rainbow (a magic rainbow)
so big it bends the light

you know it takes away
it takes the fun out
maybe i can't be asked (maybe i can't be asked)
to crash your currency

these kind of phone calls
these cans of aerosol
these massive egos (these massive egos)
so big they bend the light

who knows what
it wants from me
this goes where
it wants to be
the honey for the honeybee

well i am gonna
count to three
just keep this shit
away from me

honestly
come on, honey
read the room

honestly
come on, honey
read the room (read the room)

who knows what
it wants from me
this goes where
it wants to be
honey for the honeybee

i am gonna
count to three
just keep this shit
away from me

come on
out
come on
out
know you're
in there

know you're
in there

everybody thinks so

everybody thinks so

everybody thinks so

everybody thinks so
</pre></div>
