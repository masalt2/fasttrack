Pyramid Song is the second track on Amnesiac, Radiohead's fifth studio album. Although it doesn't sound like it, it's written entirely in 4/4.
It makes use of a dotted quarter note rhythm. The lenth of each chord in eighth notes for every bar would be 3, 3, 4, 3, 3.</p>

The lyrics go:
<pre>
i jumped in the river, what did i see?
black eyed angels swam with me
a moon full of stars and astral cars
and all things i used to see

all my lovers were there with me
all my past and future
and we all went to heaven in a little row boat
there was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt

i jumped into the river
black eyed angels swam with me
a moon full stars and astral cars
and all the things i used to see

all my lovers were there with me
all my past and future
and we all went to heaven in a little row boat
there was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
there was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
there was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
</pre></div>
