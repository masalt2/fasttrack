The lyrics go:
<pre>
there are bad things
to talk about
be constructive

there are weapons
we can use
be constructive
with your blues

even when it's only warning
even when you talk war games

oh won't you quiet down?               
                                       ...the promised land!
oh won't you quiet down?               i wanna be in the children's land!
                                       i don't know, maybe, maybe i
oh won't you quiet down?               maybe wander the promised land!
                                       i want peace and honesty!
oh won't you quiet down?               i wanna live in the promised land!
                                       maybe wander the children's land!
quiet down                             yeahhh!!!
                                       and there we can free!!!!!           

you do not run another business now, and
you never go out and you never stay

we're nowhere close in our liberal worlds
living in times where thou can't stand it, babe

all over babies crying
and now it all'll be maybe-
i can see out of here

all over the planet's dying
all over the planet-
so let me out of here

all over

quiet down                             we are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence and the marks and yen
why don't you quiet down?              and yeah we're gonna crack your little souls, we're gonna crack your little souls
why don't you quiet down?              we are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence the pounds
why don't you quiet down?              and yeah we're gonna crack your little souls, crack your little souls
                                       
                                       we are the dollars and cents
